Place is a personal profile with photos. The website created within the bootcamp with mobile-first approach and adapted for different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile phone). This page also includes some functionality as editing profile info, adding new photo-cards and likes for other photos. Popups forms have validation. This project helped to practice OOP and JavaScript.
